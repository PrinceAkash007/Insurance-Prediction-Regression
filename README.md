**Business Objective?**


The client in this case study is an insurance company in the healthcare industry. One of their main areas of focus is the cost of future insurance claims. They would like to understand the factors that lead to higher healthcare costs and develop a predictive model to prepare for future claims and help manage their risk. To provide a more targeted cost prediction, I will build a model for each of the four regions where the company's policyholders reside.
